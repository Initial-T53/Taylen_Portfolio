# [Project 1: Diabetes Risk Prediction & Early Detection: Project Overview](https://github.com/Initial-T53/Diabetes-Risk-Project)
* Built a machine Learning model to predict diabetes diagnosis using demographic, lifestyle and metabolic indicators.
* Tested Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost ; selected Random Forest for lowest false positives.
* Used SHAP values to interpret predictions: HbA1c, fasting glucose and postprandial glucose were top predictors.
* Created a risk stratification tool with low/medium/high threasholds to guide preventive care.

# [Project 2: ICU Patient Outcome Analysis : Project overview](https://github.com/Initial-T53/ICU-Patient-Analysis)
* Analyzed and worked with ICU electronic medical records to identify predictors of mortality and legnth of stay.
* Used Ordinary least squares, lasso regression, ridge regression and random forest model. GridsearchCV was used to hypertune lasso and ridge regression
* Identified features that are strong associated with patients length of stay and mortality risk
* Recommended risk-wristbands and medication recommender system.
